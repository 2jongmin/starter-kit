# Domo Apps Starter Kit
[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

## Getting Started
1. clone this repo
    `$ git clone git@github.com:DomoApps/starter-kit.git {APP_NAME}`
2. install dependencies `$ npm install`
3. create new (empty) repo on github and copy it's SSH link
4. run setup command `$ npm run setup` and follow prompts
5. configure `manifest.json` file
6. upload to domo `$ npm run upload`

### What does the setup task do?
1. Configures `package.json` { name, version, decription, repository } props.
2. renames git remote to this repo from 'origin' to generator.
3. creates new 'origin' remote to newly created repo
4. adds and commit's all new files
5. pushes changes to remote.

## Usage
- `$ npm setup` to setup your repo to new git remote
- `$ npm start` to run webpack-dev-server
- `$ npm test` to run unit tests
- `$ npm run tdd` to continuously run tests
- `$ npm run eslint` to lint code
- `$ npm run build` to build (and minify)
- `$ npm version (patch|minor|major)` to create git release
- `$ npm run upload` to upload new version to domo. aka `domo publish`

## Adding or removing platform views (mobile, desktop)
- Change config values at top of `webpack.config.js`

```js
// set views to true if you want to include them in you app
// these can be changed at any time.
var INCLUDE_DESKTOP_VIEW = true;
var INCLUDE_MOBILE_VIEW = true;
```

## Updates
To update your build tools, we can use git to handle most of the hard work for us.

```bash
$ git pull generator master
```

You may have to resolve some merge conflicts but for the most part, this should be pretty painless.

### Updating CDN'd dependencies
If you would like to add/edit/remove a dependency from a CDN, you'll need to add/edit/remove the script tag in your main HTML file, you'll also have to add/edit/remove it to the `webpack.config.js`'s `externals` property and to the `karma.conf.js`'s array variable called CDNS.

## Style Guides
- For now, we're writing everything as CommonJS2 modules.
- For CSS rules, please see [Reasonable CSS](http://rscss.io/)
- For JS rules, please see [AirBnB's styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- For Angular rules, please see [John Papa's styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide)

## Future Plans
- [x] configurable proxy
- [ ] localization strategy
- [ ] closure optimization as soon as it's ready for babel 6

# Domo Widgets (visualization components)

Domo has a growing library of visualization components (we call them widgets) that we have developed over time and incorporated into the apps that we have created. These widgets are built on top of a charting library called [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) and a framework on top of d3.js called [d3.chart](http://misoproject.com/d3-chart/). In order to consume these widgets, you don't *need* to be very familiar with these libraries and frameworks although a familiarity would be helpful. 

These widgets are available to download as dependencies to your project via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and they are all name-spaced to the [@domoinc](https://www.npmjs.com/org/domoinc) organization. They are bundled as [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) modules so they should be consumable by most JavaScript bundlers and module systems (eg. RequireJS, Webpack, Browserify, Rollup). To see a list of all of our available widgets, simply navigate your browser to [https://www.npmjs.com/org/domoinc](https://www.npmjs.com/org/domoinc).

### Example
1. Install desired widget `$ npm i -S @domoinc/barchart`
2. Include widget into source code via module system or script tag.
3. Create instance of chart by passing the constructor a d3 selection.
4. Set chart's configurable options via `config` method.
5. Set chart's accessor functions via `accessor` method.
6. Draw chart by passing data to chart method.
   
```js
 // CommonJS (webpack, browserify)
 const d3 = require('d3');
 const BarChart = require('@domoinc/bar-chart');
 const chart = new BarChart(d3.select('#chart'))
   .accessor('value', 'value', d => d.value)
   .config('width', 500)
   .draw(data);
 
 // AMD (RequireJS)
 define(['d3', 'bar-chart'], function(d3, BarChart) {
 var chart = new BarChart(d3.select('#chart'));
   chart
    .accessor('value', function(d) { return d.value; })
    .config('width', 500)
    .draw(data);
 });
 
 // globals (via script tag)
 var chart = new BarChart(d3.select('#chart'));
 chart
   .accessor('value', function(d) { return d.value; });
   .config('width', 500)
   .draw(data);
```
