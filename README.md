# da-webpack
## Getting Started
1. clone this repo 
    `$ git clone git@git.empdev.domo.com:AppTeam6/da-webpack.git {APP_NAME}`
2. rename the remote `$ git remote rename origin generator`
3. create new repo and create new origin remote that points to that repo.
    `$ git remote add origin {remote_path}`
4. Change "name" property in package.json to app name.
5. push code to new repo `$ git push origin master`

## Usage 
- `$ npm start` to run webpack-dev-server
- `$ npm test` to run unit tests
- `$ npm tdd` to continuously run tests
- `$ npm run eslint` to lint code
- `$ npm run build` to build (and minify)
- `$ npm version (patch|minor|major)` to create git release

## Adding or removing platform views (mobile, desktop)
- Change config values at top of `webpack.config.js`

```js
// set views to true if you want to include them in you app
// these can be changed at any time.
var INCLUDE_DESKTOP_VIEW = true;
var INCLUDE_MOBILE_VIEW = true;
```

## Updates
To update your build tools, we can use git to handle most of the hard work for us.

```bash
$ git pull generator master
```

You may have to resolve some merge conficts but for the most part, this should be pretty painless.
